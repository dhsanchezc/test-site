    <h1>The car</h1>
    <img src="images/car.png" alt="My red car" />
    <p>A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on
        roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people instead of goods.</p>
    <p>The year <strong>1886</strong> is regarded as the birth year of the car, when German inventor Carl Benz patented
        his <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/1885Benz.jpg">Benz Patent-Motorwagen</a>. Cars
        became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908
        Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they
        replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.</p>
    <p>There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest
        payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees,
        taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include:</p>

        <li>maintaining roads</li>
        <li>road congestion</li>
        <li>healthcare</li>
        <li>air pollution</li>
    </ol>
